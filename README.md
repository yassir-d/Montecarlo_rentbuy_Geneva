# 🏠 Rent vs Buy Decision Simulator — Geneva  
**Data Science • Monte Carlo Simulation • Financial Modeling**

---

## Project Description

Deciding whether to **rent or buy** a property is one of the biggest financial decisions people face — especially in Geneva, where:

- Housing prices are high
- Mortgage rates fluctuate
- Rent inflation is unpredictable
- Real estate data is hard to interpret

This project builds a **simulation-based decision tool** that models the financial outcome of renting vs buying in Geneva over time.

Instead of simplistic calculators, this tool uses:

Monte Carlo simulation (thousands of stochastic scenarios)  
Real-world economic parameters (rent inflation, interest rates, property appreciation)  
Optional ML forecasting (price prediction using regression)  
Clear visualization of outcomes ("Buying wins in 68% of simulations")

**User Output Example:**

> _"In Geneva, buying becomes financially better than renting after **7.3 years** with **74% confidence**."_
